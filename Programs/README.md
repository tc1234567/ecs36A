# Monty-Hall

PartI.

To provide functions that would allow you to play a single game. The basic concept is to generate a random number that represents the door behind which the real prize is hidden, as well as a random number that represents the door that the competitor first chooses. Monty pushes open the final door. Then have the contestant switch doors (or not switch doors) to see if the prize is behind that door.

PartII.

We're going to simulate a lot of games now. To ask the user how many games they want to play. To play one set of games for the contestant who is always changing doors and another set of games for the contestant who is never changing doors. The resultant fraction of times the competitor wins, as well as the number of games won, will be printed.


PartIII.

To visualise the findings, add a graphical output. To make a histogram, the bars represent the relative sizes of the values.
